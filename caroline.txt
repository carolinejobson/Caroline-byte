Hi, My name is Caroline. :)
<p> I currently work as a Product Manager at JPMorgan Chase. There, I own the end-to-end delivery of Wealth Plan, a retail wealth product that offers an aggregated view of finances, regardless of institution.</p>

<p> Previously, I worked at an early-stage PropTech SaaS company as the first product hire. I am proficient in JavaScript, Node.JS, VSCode, HTML5, CSS, Git, GitHub, and command-line arguments.</p>
