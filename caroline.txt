Hi! My name is Caroline.
<p> I currently work as a Product Manager within Consumer and Community Banking at JPMorgan Chase. There, I own much of the Wealth Plan summary dashboard, a retail wealth product that offers an aggregated view of finances, regardless of institution. Previously, I worked at an early-stage PropTech SaaS company as the first product hire. I am proficient in Javascript, Node.JS, HTML5, CSS, Git, GitHub, and command-line arguments.</p>
